College basketball matchup voting app

## Summary
This is a polling website that will generate a NCAA tournament bracket based on the votes from users of the website.  It will allow you to vote on who will win upcoming games to be played in college basketball while showing you the current percentage of people who think each team will win.  The bracket that will load will be based on current voting.

## Existing Features
* Vote for college matchups
* Show current percentage of votes for each team 
* Randomly populate team matchups
* Update voting perctage dynamically

## Code Summary
Initial purpose for the project was for HTTP method practice with PHP and updating data dynamically in the browser with that information.  However,I plan to extend this project to be more useful.

* Create a NCAA bracket based on the teams current record, rank, and other aggregate data.
